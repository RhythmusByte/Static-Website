          <h1>SUPERCELL</h1>
          <p id="paragraph">
            Supercell is a game company based in Helsinki, Finland, with offices
            in San Francisco, Seoul and Shanghai. Since our launch in 2010, we've
            brought five games to the global market – Hay Day, Clash of Clans,
            Boom Beach, Clash Royale and Brawl Stars. Our dream is to create great
            games that as many people as possible play for years and that are
            remembered forever.
          </p>

          <h1>Why We Are Here</h1>

          <p>
            Supercell was founded on the idea of giving game developers and teams the independence to decide what kinds of games they make and how they choose to make them. Over a decade and five global games later, our dream still stands: to create great games that as many people as possible play for years and that are remembered forever.
            <br><br>
            We believe games have the power to bring people around the world together and closer to each other. We work to create new, innovative, memorable experiences no one has played before. This is why we try to design games that excite wide and diverse player communities as well as to expand the audience for otherwise smaller “niche” game concepts.
            <br><br>
            There’s no simple recipe or magic formula to achieve our dream. What we do know, however, is that without players Supercell doesn’t exist. Creating lovable worlds and characters that players want to come back to over and over again is at the heart of how we design and operate our games.
          </p>

            “Are we building something that could be important?”</h3>
